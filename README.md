# SQL DATAWAREHOUSE PROJECT
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL Processes and data modelling 

## **Building the Data Warehouse - Data Engineering**

**Objective**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data for enhanced analytical reporting and decision-making.

**Specifications**

- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) in CSV format.
- Data Quality: Clean and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
- Integration: Create a unified, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.
- Scope: Focus on current dataset onlyâ€”no historical data required.
- Documentation: Create comprehensive data model documentation for business users and stakeholders.

- ## **DATA ARCHITECTURE**

1. **Bronze Layer**: This is where we first save our raw data exactly as it comes from the CSV files into SQL Server. Think of it like a storage room where we keep everything untouched!
2. **Silver Layer**: Here we clean up our data - fix spelling mistakes, remove duplicates, and organize it better. It's like tidying up the storage room and putting things in order.
3. **Gold Layer**: Finally, we organize the clean data into a special format (star schema) that makes it super easy to create reports and analyze. This is where business users can easily find what they need!

## Naming Conventions

**Structure:** Snake case

**Language:** English

**Bronze Layer**: source_entity/tablename,  example: crm_customer_info

**Silver Layer:** source_entity/tablename, example: crm_customer_info

**Gold Layer:** category_entity, example: fact_sales or agg_customers
